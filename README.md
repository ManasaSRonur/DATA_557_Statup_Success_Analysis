# The Formula for Fortune

In this study, we investigate the factors influencing startup success using data from Crunchbase, focusing on investments and associated attributes including the profiles of the key personnels involved in a startup. For analysis purposes, success is defined as either companyâ€™s acquisition or operating for over 5 years. We explore several research questions, including the relationship between industry type and success rate. Our findings reveal a significant association, with manufacturing demonstrating the highest success proportion. We also examine the impact of location on success, noting the associations at both country and city levels, with the U.S. leading in success proportion. Surprisingly, we find no relationship  between founders holding STEM degrees and success rate of the startups. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers that equity crowdfunding tends to decrease the success probability of a startup while the secondary markets are more associated with success. Notably, recession years show marked differences in startup success metrics. This report provides entrepreneurs, investors, and policymakers with invaluable guidance by synthesising insights gleaned from these multifaceted analyses. It emphasises how crucial it is to take into account regional variables, funding sources, industry dynamics, and prevailing economic conditions when attempting to maximise strategic choices and increase the probability of startup success.
